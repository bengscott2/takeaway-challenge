Takeaway Challenge
===================
This is my version of the takeaway challenge. My approach is to try to leave the code as open to extension as possible. So you should be able to add functionality without modifying the original code.


Instructions
============
* Run `bundle install` to install all gems.
* Run the program in `irb`
* `irb -r ./lib/takeaway.rb`
